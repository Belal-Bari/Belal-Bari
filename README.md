# Hello hello ! 👋 <br/>

### A bit about me <br/>
Not so long ago, I started learning frontend and backend development, built a few projects for fun and now applying those knowledge to contribute in the development of a startup platform. But since the spring of '25, my interests have grown into knowing more about DevOps toolings and Cloud technologies. Feel free to checkout my current ongoing project:<br/>

Apart from these, I also love to read about pentesting and in my free time I play wargames at [Over The Wire](OverTheWire.org/wargames/). Lastly, if you are a table-tennis fan, hit me up!.<br/>
