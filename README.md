# Hello hello ! 👋 <br/>
I'm Belal, a curious, self-motivated and a helpful person 😄. I'm currently completing my master's degree in Cybersecurity.<br/>

### A bit about me <br/>
Not so long ago, I started learning frontend and backend development, built a few projects for fun and now applying those knowledge to contribute in the development of a startup platform. But since the spring of '25, my interests have grown into knowing more about DevOps toolings and Cloud technologies. Feel free to checkout my current ongoing project:<br/>
- 🔭 [End-to-end devops project (Build-test-deploy)](https://github.com/Belal-Bari/jenkins-terraform-aws-eks-cicd-pipeline-project) <br/>

Apart from these, I also love to read about pentesting and in my free time I play wargames at [Over The Wire](OverTheWire.org/wargames/) and try to solve some challenges at [Sad Servers](https://www.sadservers.com). <br/>

Lastly, if you are a table-tennis 🏓 enthusiast, hit me up!.<br/>
